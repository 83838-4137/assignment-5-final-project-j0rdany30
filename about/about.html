            <h2>Message</h2>
            <p>Being born and raised on the Caribbean island of Jamaica, I come from a rich cultural heritage. Jerk is a style of cooking native to Jamaica, in which meat is dry-rubbed or wet marinated with a hot spice mixture called Jamaican jerk spice. The authentic jerk was originally cooked in the ground covered with pimento wood and peppers. Rum is a liquor made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses or sugarcane juice. Jamaican rums have won awards worldwide. One of the most popular rums from Jamaica is Appleton, which has been in business for over 100 years. It is a tradition in my household, that on public holidays, our family and friends gather and have a cookout. The meals will include Jerk Chicken and Pork. We also have a variety of beverages which will include rum. I founded 876 Bar and Grill to capture and share this unique experience cultivated by both my heritage and family traditions.</p>

            <p>Our mission at 876 is to present a re-imagined authentic Jamaican grilling and drinking    experience through a contemporary lens inspiredby family traditions. 876 offers a unique experience by not only serving authentic contemporary Jamaican cuisine and drinks but will also following traditional Jamaican bar/grill practices. Its setting will capture a modern-rustic  jerk center, that grills outdoors on a bed of sweetwood and pimento sticks, covered with large sheets of corrugated tin. Its bar provides a broad selection of Jamaica's finest rum spirits and the entertainment covers a wide array of Jamaican music genres both live and pre-recorded.</p>

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Most Jamaican or Caribbean restaurants also create generic experiences that serve unimaginative cuisine. The Jamaican national motto is 'Out of Many One People' referring to the population's multicultural roots. Jamaican cuisine is a product of this melting pot. At 876 we aim to give customers, who are of the age of 21 and over, from all economic, cultural, and racial backgrounds a fresh modern take on what it means and feels like to be a Jamaican.</p>
